class InitialBlock(nn.Module):
    """The initial block is composed of two branches:
    1. a main branch which performs a regular convolution with stride 2;
    2. an extension branch which performs max-pooling.
    Doing both operations in parallel and concatenating their results
    allows for efficient downsampling and expansion. The main branch
    outputs 13 feature maps while the extension branch outputs 3, for a
    total of 16 feature maps after concatenation.
    
    Keyword arguments:
    - in_channels (int): the number of input channels.
    - out_channels (int): the number output channels.
    - kernel_size (int, optional): the kernel size of the filters used in
    the convolution layer. Default: 3.
    - padding (int, optional): zero-padding added to both sides of the
    input. Default: 0.
    - bias (bool, optional): Adds a learnable bias to the output if
    ``True``. Default: False.
    - relu (bool, optional): When ``True`` ReLU is used as the activation
    function; otherwise, PReLU is used. Default: True.
